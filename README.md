# covido_app

Covido app is my very first application developed in Dart, designed for IOS and Android allowing to generate its output certificate in a single click.

Application developed during the first containment, did not succeed in order to promote the [TousAntiCovid](https://bonjour.tousanticovid.gouv.fr/) application highlighted on the application.

The application is voluntarily functional only on certain points so that users favor the use of [TousAntiCovid](https://bonjour.tousanticovid.gouv.fr/) rather than Covido.

Note: Pdf's are created beautifully and well, they are directly stored in the download folder of your phone.
